# vacuum-world

This was an old react project I made early in my career. See [page](https://jamesgadoury.github.io/vacuum-world/). It isn't very good. Notably, the bfs implementation is incorrect. Keeping public for sentimental reasons. I implemented a (imo) better version of this here: [repo](https://github.com/jamesGadoury/vacuum-world-canvas), [page](https://jamesgadoury.github.io/vacuum-world-canvas/).
